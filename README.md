# cs540hw2tester
This is a public tester for UW Madison's CS540's HW2. The program name is funny_puzzle.py.

To run this tester, download the test.py and ref.txt files to your working
folder. 

On linux, use python3 ./test.py

On windows cmd, you might have to use py test.py

Make sure you have numpy installed.

If your output matches mine (Saurabh's), you'll only see the following line:

"If this is all you see, your code is good."

Otherwise, you'll see something like this:

Yours: Max queue length: 367

Ref:   Max queue length: 366

Note: This program will generate a file called test.txt. Deleting or modifying
it will not affect the operation of the tester.

I'm on discord as -smashndash- if you want to contact me. 

BTW don't worry about the license or whatever. I just picked that
because github forced me to. I don't care who gets a copy of this or
uses this in their program.
